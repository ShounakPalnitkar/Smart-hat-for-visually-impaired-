This project involves the development of a smart hat designed to assist visually impaired individuals with navigation. The hat integrates real-time obstacle and object detection, providing users with feedback to help them navigate their environment safely. The system includes voice command functionality for hands-free interaction and navigation assistance, guiding users with directional cues. A Python-based dashboard is integrated into the web app, allowing users to monitor the systemâ€™s activity and interact with it in real-time. The web app, along with the dashboard, was deployed on Render for testing purposes, though no permanent connection to Render is required for the app's functionality.
